The basic cards https://imgur.com/a/uh9sL
The combo cards https://imgur.com/a/d3pvN

This is currently a very simple program that allows you to draw a random card into your hand, and discard it at anytime.

#TODO
Add support for combo cards
Maybe add a timer in the app somehwere
Make the game aware of the cards. Currently each card object is just a picture with no defining characteristics. (i.e. point value or task)
